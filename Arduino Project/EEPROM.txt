EEPROM Master Block Layout

0: 
(1) 01 initialized
(1) EEPROM version number must match version in firmware


20:
(1) FE initialized

(x) data blocks for objects in main.ino

(1) FF FF FF Terminator

500: Profiles data structure


** each object EEPROM storage function will:
    - be passed the first open address it is allowed to read/write
    - check first available byte for FE, as initializer byte
    - Store all values it should store between power cycles
    - Then, perform a call to child EEPROM blocks, functioning the same as this one
    - Fill some spare bytes, for adding information later (probably 4 integers/8 bytes or smthn)
    - Terminate block with FE FE FE, and return the number of bytes consumed (or address of next open byte), for next block to use
    
** 0 eeprom value means use default setting in airsettings.h
